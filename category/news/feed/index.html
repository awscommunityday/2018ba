								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call for papers for </span><a href="https://awscommunityday.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Community Day SF Bay Area 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is open, and we want to hear from you! </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/events/community-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS Community Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> events are community-organized full day events featuring technical discussions led by expert AWS users and community leaders from around the world. These events happen at different cities around the world and give AWS users a venue similar to re:Invent and Summit, except they are local and free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the ACD in the Bay Area will be an exciting place for the community to gather. And we are thrilled that you want to join us. Tell us your stories, share your lessons learned, lay out your best practices for forward-thinking practitioners and industry leaders from financial services, healthcare, education, transportation, entertainment and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendees at ACD are eager to learn from your successes, failures, and experiments. Share how you adopted new AWS services and reimagined old ones. Tell us about your journey and your outcomes. What tips and tricks do you have for improving the effectiveness of adopting AWS. Everyone has something to teach and we are all eager to learn!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFP basics:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadline: Friday, April 5, 2019 at 11:59 PM Pacific Time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track theme ideas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of Things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Containers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serverless</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and so on</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/tWyo2MwrvCqZBgKi2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submit now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why submit to ACD SF BA 2019?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, we love having everyone share their stories at the AWS Community Day. Our communities are driven by sharing stories, experiences, challenges, successes, everything in between.  The more stories our community shares, the more everyone learns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure what to submit a talk about? ACD 2019 is an ideal venue to highlight an awesome project your team has worked on. Our community helps put a human face on the industry buzzwords and lingo, bringing the real world into the spotlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at an event like AWS Community Day is a unique opportunity to build your brand and expand your speaker profile, and allows you to highlight your team as a great place to work for hiring managers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an internal tool that you’re proud of and want to share? Can you open source it and share it with the AWS community? Find like-minded folks and maybe even some future contributors for your project with a talk at AWS Community Day 2019.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s in a good proposal?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell us a good story, but be clear about what your talk will focus on. We love a catchy title and a slick abstract, but give us the key points you’re planning to cover, why the ACD audience will find those points compelling, and why you’re the best person to speak on the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning to present with a demo, let us know that too! Demos are great for sharing technical ideas. Bringing a co-presenter is great too, just let us know. We can also accommodate panel discussions, but please reach out to us for those.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to </span><a href="mailto:john.n.varghese@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">john.n.varghese@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re happy to help with your submission ideas and anything else you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope to see you soon!</span></p>
